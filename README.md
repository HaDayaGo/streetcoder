# about

This repository contains example code snippets 
referenced in my book [Street Coder](https://streetcoder.org)
published by Manning Books.

# requirements

Most of the code requires at least .NET 5 to be built with one project being in
.NET Framework which is required for the migration example. You can download the latest
.NET SDK at [Microsoft's download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

I used [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
whose Community Edition is free, but you should also be able to use 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
if you find it more comfortable.
