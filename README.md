# requirements

Most of the code requires at least .NET Core SDK 3.1
to be built. You can download the latest
.NET SDK at [Microsoft's download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

I used [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
whose Community Edition is free, but you should also be able to use 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
if you find it more comfortable.
